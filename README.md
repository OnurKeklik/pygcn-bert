This implementation makes use of the Full Context PeerRead dataset (https://bert-gcn-for-paper-citation.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/PeerRead/full_context_PeerRead.csv) and BERT embeddings as feature.

## Installation

```python setup.py install```

## Requirements

  * PyTorch 0.4 or 0.5
  * Python 2.7 or 3.6

## Usage
```python createdataset.py```
```python train.py```
